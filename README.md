# ðŸ”— LinkVault â€“ Link Management API

**LinkVault** is a simple, lovable, and complete personal project designed as a link management system. It allows users to register, store, organize, and manage their personal links with tags.

This backend service is built with **Go** using the **Fiber framework**, applies **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, and connects to a **PostgreSQL** database.

## Tech Stack

- **Go Fiber** â€“ web framework
- **GORM** â€“ ORM for PostgreSQL
- **JWT Auth** â€“ for secure user authentication
- **PostgreSQL** â€“ relational database
- **golang-migrate** â€“ database migration tool
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** â€“ modular project structure

## Features

- User registration & login with JWT
- Create, update, delete, and list personal links
- Tag support: list tags by user
- Secure route protection with JWT middleware
- Clean architecture with DDD
